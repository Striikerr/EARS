# EARS
Easy Album Rating System

This is a program I created and have been slowly refining and making easier to use and navigate.

DISCLAIMER: 
I AM NOT A PROFESSIONAL PROGRAMMER 

This application is very likely to be; inefficent, buggy, and extremely primative.
I simply use this for my own benefit, and have uploaded it onto here incase anyone, comes across this and wants to use it, or anyone asks for what i use in the future. 


Currently the program allows you to rate albums using either 0-5, 0-10, or 0-100 rating scales, it also has a function that allows you to add a very slight extra score advantage to longer albums. 
There is a settings "menu" included inside the program, but if you're feeling adventurous/knowledgeable you can always toy about in the .config file and included .py file to add your own features or fix any bugs you find, although if you end up breaking anything and the code isn't exactly to what I have on my machine it's unlikely I'd be able to help you. You can also search an indluded database of all your scores and export them to a .json file.

I doubt i will get round to many, but if you have any ideas or find any issues, feel free to make posts in their respective sections on the github page.


# Details on updating
All you need to do to keep your database and config settings is copy the album_data.json and config.ini files (or delete them from the rar when downloading the new version) and then merge them all together.

1. Download new release.
2. Make a copy of your previous "album_data.json" and "config.ini" and or remove the same files from the new release.
3. Drag and drop the new files into the folder you have EARS located. (Overwriting where appropriate)
4. If you moved .json and ini out of the folder, copy it back into the EARS folder.
5. Launch the program and check that you can correctly search the database and add new albums.

If you feel like being extra safe, copying your .json and ini into the new release will likely always be safer, as you can always revert back to the previous version without potentially breaking anything. Only issue is it makes an extra folder.
