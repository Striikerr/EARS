Easy Album Rating System

This is a program I created and have been slowly refining and making easier to use and navigate.

DISCLAIMER: 
I AM NOT A PROFESSIONAL PROGRAMMER 

This application is very likely to be; inefficent, buggy, and extremely primative.
I simply use this for my own benefit, and have uploaded it onto here incase anyone, comes across this and wants to use it, or anyone asks for what i use in the future. 


Currently the program allows you to rate albums using either 0-5, 0-10, or 0-100 rating scales, it also has a function that allows you to add a very slight extra score advantage to longer albums. 
There is a settings "menu" included inside the program, but if you're feeling adventurous you can always toy about in the .config file, although it's unlikely adding anything will end up doing helpful for the program since a lot of the things for this are hard coded. You can also display and export files to a .json file.

I doubt i will get round to many, but if you have any ideas or find any issues, feel free to make posts in their respective sections on the github page.
