Things to keep in mind

1) I am not a professional programmer, it's entirely possible there are better ways of doing this, and things are VERY likely to break.
2) It will export to a json file in the directory, if you know how to use that file type, you can utilize it for more advanced things you want to do on your own. 
3) Enjoy music!


Planned things for future versions (if i ever even do any)

Better overall navigation
An actual UI or something similar.
